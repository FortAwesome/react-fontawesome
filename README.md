## Documentation

Version 3.0.0 is a major update for `react-fontawesome` with the library being rewritten from plain JS to TypeScript,
amongst a number of performance improvements and optimisations to the `FontAwesomeIcon` React component.

While it is a major update, there should be no breaking changes aside from those noted in the Compatibility section below.

## Compatibility

With the release of FontAwesome v7, we have marked v5 as End-of-Life. Both v6 and v7 will continue to be supported.

In `react-fontawesome v3.0.0` we have also dropped support for End-of-Life versions of React and Node.js as well as IE11 browser support.

If you need to use `react-fontawesome` with legacy versions, please consult the table below.

| React version | react-fontawesome version | FontAwesome Core versions | Node versions    |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| >= 18.0.0     | 3.x.x                     | 6.x, 7.x                  | 20.x, 22.x, 24.x |
| >= 16.3.0     | 0.2.x                     | 5.x, 6.x, 7.x             | 18.x, 20.x       |
| < 16.3.0      | 0.1.x                     | 5.x, 6.x                  | 14.x, 16.x       |
