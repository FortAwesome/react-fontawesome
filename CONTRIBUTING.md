This is the repository for the _official_ Font Awesome React component, _initialized_ by the team behind Font Awesome,
but intended to evolve over time with _community_ contributions.

# Ways to Contribute

## Ask a Question

Trying to figure out how to make it work? Or how to use it in your scenario?

1.  Review the [README](README.md)
1.  Get familiar with the documentation for the [SVG with JavaScript](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/svg-with-js) implementation,
    the framework upon which this component is built. Sometimes the answers you need may be there.
1.  Post any remaining questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-fontawesome) with the tag `react-fontawesome`.

## Report a Bug

1.  Create a test case that reproduces the unexpected behavior
1.  [Open a new issue with this template](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome/issues/new?template=bug-report.md),
    and be sure to include a link to the reproduction you made with StackBlitz.

## Submit a Pull Request

Add tests if you add code.

## Everything Else

- [Request a feature](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome/issues/new??title=Feature%20request:feature-name&template=feature-request.md)
- [Request a new icon](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/new?title=Icon%20request:%20icon-name&template=icon-request.md)

# Project Goals

1.  Achieve and maintain feature parity with Font Awesome's [SVG with JavaScript](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/svg-with-js) method.

1.  Keep with best practices in the React development community.

1.  Stay current with major developments in React and create-react-app

1.  Maintain a reasonable level of consistency between this component and the other Font Awesome official JavaScript
    framework components ([Vue](https://github.com/FortAwesome/vue-fontawesome), [Angular](https://github.com/FortAwesome/angular-fontawesome), [Ember](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome))

1.  Sharing responsibility: The Font Awesome team will continue to be involved in ongoing development, hoping to _propel_
    the project's momentum as we make _our_ contributions, while minimizing any bottle-necking that may happen as we balance
    our own priorities across various projects. Ideally, members of the community will enjoy lending a hand to help keep
    the project moving forward by responding to issues, answering questions on StackOverflow, reviewing and merging pull
    requests, and publishing npm updates.
